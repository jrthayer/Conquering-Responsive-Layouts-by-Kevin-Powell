Day 1 - Using percentages & avoiding heights
------------------------------------------------------
Websites are naturally responsive if you are running into issues
it is something the programmer has defined.

width(default) is 100% of parent element. 
Don't set fixed widths!!!!
Set widths to %.

Heights are usually a bad thing.

Default font size of most browsers is 16px!!!!
